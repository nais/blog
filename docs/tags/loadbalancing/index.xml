      <description>Why change? With an ambition of making our environments as secure as possible, we jumped on the service-mesh bandwagon in 2018 with Istio 0.7 and have stuck with it since.
Istio is a large and feature rich system that brings capabilities aplenty. Although there are a plethora of nifty and useful things we could do with Istio, we&amp;rsquo;ve primarily used it for mTLS and authorization policies.
One might think that having lots of features available but not using them couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly be a problem.</description>
